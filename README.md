# RAG-Based-LLM-Application

# Advanced RAG Pipeline for Question Answering
This repository contains an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for question answering using the LLaMA 3 model integrated with LangChain, along with a fine-tuning capability and a FastAPI interface for serving the model.

# Components :
# 1, Advanced RAG Pipeline with LLaMA 3: The pipeline includes document parsing, embedding generation, FAISS indexing, and generating answers using a locally running LLaMA model.
# 2. Fine-Tuning Pipeline for LLaMA 3: A pipeline to fine-tune the LLaMA model on custom question-answer data to enhance its performance on domain-specific queries.
# 3. FastAPI to serve the RAG model: A FastAPI server that provides an endpoint for querying the RAG model.

# Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd rag_pipeline_repository
Install the necessary dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
# 1. Set Up Environment
Set up the environment by installing all necessary dependencies:

python scripts/setup_environment.py
# 2. Download Required Documents
Download the required documents from Google Drive using the download_documents in utils.py: Save documents in the data/ directory.

# 3. Fine-Tune the LLaMA Model
If you need to fine-tune the LLaMA model using domain-specific question-answer pairs, you can use the fine_tune_model.py script:

python fine_tune_model.py
This will generate a fine-tuned version of the model, saved in the models/ directory.

# 4. Run the Advanced RAG Pipeline
To query the pipeline using a document and a user query, run the advanced_rag_pipeline.py script.

# 5. Run the FastAPI Server
To serve the RAG model via FastAPI, run:

uvicorn fastapi_app:app --reload
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/query.

# API Endpoint
POST /query: Accepts a JSON payload with pdf_path and user_query. Returns the answer generated by the RAG pipeline.
Request Body:
{
  "pdf_path": "path/to/your/document.pdf",
  "user_query": "What are the highlights of the document?"
}
Response:
{
  "answer": "Generated answer from the model"
}

# Future Improvements
Integration with a Cloud Database: To store and manage large sets of documents efficiently.
Extending the API: Adding more endpoints to handle different types of questions and multi-document queries.
Deployment: Containerize the application using Docker and deploy it to a cloud platform like AWS or GCP.
